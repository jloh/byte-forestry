### [Helping One Million Developers Exit Vim](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/)  
Starting off the week with a bit of comedy, Stack Overflow does some analytics on who has the most trouble exiting VIM.

### [Bitcoin price jump](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/price-of-bitcoin-breaks-records-at-2400/)  
In the last week Bitcoin has surged in price only to [fall again later](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/newsflash-bitcoin-price-takes-sharp-fall-toward-2100/) in the week. I'm sure there are still a lot of people kicking themselves for not investing in the currency years ago.

### [Stack Overflows journey to HTTPS](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2017/05/22/https-on-stack-overflow/)  
This is a _really_ long post, but if you only have time to read one, make it this. Nick Carver (who we've [featured before!]({{< ref "2017-04-30-issue-3.md" >}})) goes into the journey that Stack Overflow went through to go full HTTPS.

### [China, The Internet of Things and How to Destroy Your Own Company](http://www.chinalawblog.com/2016/03/china-and-the-internet-of-things-and-how-to-destroy-your-own-company.html)  
This is something I had never really considered, but apparently Chinese manufacturers have a tendency to steal IoT companies IP. I just _assumed_ that companies had contracts and other pieces in place, apparently this isn't the case at all.

### [Introducing the Blockstack Browser](https://blockstack.org/blog/introducing-the-blockstack-browser-a-gateway-to-a-new-decentralized-internet)  
I'm going to be completely honest and say I have no idea what this new browser is going to be about. Maybe someone else has an idea? It looks like a new way to build platforms and browse the web? Let us know in the comments!
