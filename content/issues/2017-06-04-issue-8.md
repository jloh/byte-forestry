Apologies for the late issue! This is a short one due to having a busy week, still quite a few good articles!

### [British Airways IT engineer blamed for outage](http://beta.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11868636)  
With the fallout of British Airways' IT disaster last week, they have now apparently blamed it on a _sole engineer_. After trying to [gag staff](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3672676/british-airways-boss-tries-gag-staff-it-failure/) I'm unsure what to believe.

### [Stanford University WP sites hosts malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/stanford-university-site-hosted-malware-for-months/)  
 I honestly don't get how this happens. WordPress as a product isn't that hard to protect and for a university to not notice that one of its subdomains was hosting malware for so long is shocking.

### [NYPD Claimed Its LRAD Sound Cannon Isn't A Weapon](http://gothamist.com/2017/06/01/lrad_lawsuit_nypd.php)  
I hate going after cops but I hadn't ever heard about this LARD cannon before this article, I'm interested in what people think of it. After watching the video I imagine it would have to be one of those things you can't _really_ grasp until it happens to you.

### [Accidentally destroyed production database on first day of a job](https://np.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/)  
Redditor /u/cscareerthrowaway567 managed to delete the production database on the first day of his job. I have to admit, I don't think this was _his fault at all_. Who the hell gives people production access in a document on their first day? GitLab's Yorick made a [great comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/dieitun/) about his experience doing the same thing.

### [Why do so few people major in computer science?](http://danwang.co/why-so-few-computer-science-majors/)  
A lot of good maths and figures in this post although it is heavily based around US numbers.
